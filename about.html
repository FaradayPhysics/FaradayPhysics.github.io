<h1> Relatively Interesting </h1>
<p> This website serves as an online repository of all the physics related curiosities that have caught my attention over the years. These range from materials produced for my students during my day job as a physics teacher, to long winded essays tracing the evolution of physical ideas throughout history. If you are interested in physics, then hopefully there is something here that will catch your eye.</p>
